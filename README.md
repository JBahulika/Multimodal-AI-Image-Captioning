# 🧠 Multimodal AI Caption Recommender

An **AI-powered multimodal caption generation system** that analyzes both **image content** and **semantic meaning** to recommend contextually fitting, human-like captions.  
This project fuses **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to produce creative, intelligent caption recommendations for any uploaded image.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ **Image Understanding:** Extracts deep visual embeddings from images using **CNN-based models**.  
- 💬 **Text Embedding:** Encodes caption candidates using **transformer-based sentence representations**.  
- 🔗 **Multimodal Fusion:** Aligns **visual** and **textual** vector spaces to measure semantic similarity.  
- 🪄 **Smart Caption Recommendation:** Suggests the top captions that best match an image’s theme, tone, and emotion.  
- 📚 **Curated Caption Dataset:** Powered by ` captions_set_01.json` — a diverse collection of 1,000+ captions optimized for travel, lifestyle, and motivational content.  
- 🎨 **Streamlit Interface:** Aesthetic, simple, and interactive UI for real-time caption generation.

## 🧠 Core Concept

The model bridges the **visual world** and the **linguistic world** through embedding alignment:  
1. Visual embeddings from a **CNN** capture spatial and semantic context.  
2. Text embeddings from a **Transformer** model represent captions in a rich semantic space.  
3. Using **cosine similarity**, captions most aligned with the visual features are ranked and displayed.  

This approach mimics how humans interpret images — blending what’s *seen* with what’s *felt or expressed*.

## 🧩 Example Output

| Input Image | Generated Captions |
|--------------|-------------------|
| ☕ Coffee Cup | "A refreshing beverage." • "Taste the tradition." • "Savor the flavor." |
| 🌅 Sunset | "Chasing horizons." • "Golden hour glow." • "Peace looks like this." |
| 🌿 Forest Path | "Into the wild." • "Nature’s masterpiece." • "Find your fire." |

## 💡 Highlights

- Works across **multiple themes**: travel, aesthetics, lifestyle, nature, motivation, and more.  
- Produces **highly context-aware** and **grammatically natural** captions.  
- Modular code design allows easy integration with APIs or frontend apps.  
- Dataset fully customizable — you can extend or fine-tune it for brand-specific tone.
